# Right on target

Rules of the game:
1. The application randomly selects an integer between 1 and 50 and displays it to the player in a text label.
2. The player sets the slider to the position they believe corresponds to the number chosen by the application. The leftmost position of the slider corresponds to 1, and the rightmost position corresponds to 50. The challenge is that the player has to rely on their visual judgment.
3. The player confirms the chosen slider position by pressing a button.
4. The application determines how close the selected slider value is to the target number and calculates the score.
5. One game consists of five rounds. The goal is to achieve the highest total score.
